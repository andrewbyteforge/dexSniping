## üéØ **PROJECT MISSION: AUTOMATED PROFIT GENERATION**

**Core Value Proposition:**

- ‚úÖ **Bot monitors markets** 24/7 for opportunities  
- ‚úÖ **AI analyzes risk** and identifies profitable tokens
- ‚úÖ **Automated execution** buys low, sells high
- ‚úÖ **Profit generated** automatically for user
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard tracks** gains, losses, and performance

## üìä **CURRENT STATUS: INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE, TRADING ENGINE NEEDED**

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED INFRASTRUCTURE (Phase 3B)**

### **üö® MISSING CRITICAL COMPONENT: LIVE TRADING ENGINE**

- [ ] **üéØ PRIORITY 2: Wallet Integration** - Connect to user's wallet for transactions
- [ ] **üéØ PRIORITY 3: Order Execution** - Actually place buy/sell orders on DEXs
- [ ] **üéØ PRIORITY 4: Profit Tracking** - Calculate and display user gains
- [ ] **üéØ PRIORITY 5: Strategy Engine** - Define when to buy/sell automatically

## üî• **IMMEDIATE NEXT PHASE: LIVE TRADING IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Phase 4: Core Trading Engine (CRITICAL PRIORITY)**
**Goal:** Implement the actual trading logic that generates profit

#### **Week 1-2: Wallet Integration & Order Execution**
- [ ] **MetaMask Integration** - Connect user wallets
- [ ] **Transaction Signing** - Secure trade execution
- [ ] **DEX Router Integration** - Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap
- [ ] **Gas Optimization** - Minimize transaction costs
- [ ] **Slippage Protection** - Prevent losses from price movement

#### **Week 3-4: Automated Trading Logic**
- [ ] **Buy Triggers** - When to enter positions automatically
- [ ] **Sell Triggers** - When to exit positions for profit
- [ ] **Stop Loss Implementation** - Automated loss prevention
- [ ] **Position Sizing** - How much to invest per trade
- [ ] **Portfolio Management** - Balance across multiple positions

#### **Week 5-6: Strategy Engine**
- [ ] **Trend Following** - Buy rising tokens, sell falling ones
- [ ] **Arbitrage Detection** - Profit from price differences across DEXs
- [ ] **New Token Sniping** - Early entry on promising new launches
- [ ] **Risk-Based Position Sizing** - Larger positions on safer trades
- [ ] **Profit Taking Strategy** - When and how much to sell

## üéØ **KEY QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY PROJECT DIRECTION**

### **1. Trading Strategy Priority**
**Question:** Which automated trading strategy should we implement first?
- **Option A:** New token sniping (buy tokens at launch, sell quickly for profit)
- **Option B:** Arbitrage (profit from price differences across DEXs) 
- **Option C:** Trend following (buy rising tokens, sell when trend reverses)
- **Option D:** All three with user selection

### **2. User Capital Management**
**Question:** How should users fund their trading bot?
- **Option A:** Direct wallet connection (bot trades from user's wallet)
- **Option B:** Deposit system (users deposit funds, bot manages internal balance)
- **Option C:** Both options available

### **3. Profit Distribution**
**Question:** How should the bot generate revenue?
- **Option A:** Free platform, users keep 100% of profits
- **Option B:** Performance fee (e.g., 20% of profits)
- **Option C:** Subscription model ($10-50/month)

### **4. Risk Management Level**
**Question:** How aggressive should the default trading be?
- **Option A:** Conservative (lower risk, lower returns, 5-15% target monthly)
- **Option B:** Moderate (balanced risk, 15-30% target monthly)
- **Option C:** Aggressive (higher risk, 30%+ target monthly)
- **Option D:** User configurable

### **5. Automation Level**
**Question:** How much user control vs full automation?
- **Option A:** Fully automated (bot trades without user approval)
- **Option B:** Semi-automated (bot suggests, user approves)
- **Option C:** Both modes available

## üìã **CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE ASSESSMENT**

### **‚úÖ STRONG FOUNDATION BUILT**
- **Dashboard:** Professional interface for monitoring bot performance
- **Data Pipeline:** Real-time price feeds and market data
- **AI Analysis:** Risk assessment and honeypot detection
- **Database:** Order tracking and portfolio management models

- **No profit tracking:** Cannot calculate user gains
- **No automated strategies:** No logic for when to trade

### **üéØ REFOCUSED DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

#### **Phase 4A (Weeks 3-4):**
1. **Automated trading triggers** (basic buy/sell logic)

3. **Risk controls** (maximum position size, daily limits)

#### **Phase 4B (Weeks 5-6):**
1. **Trading strategies** (new token sniping or arbitrage)
2. **Performance optimization** (gas fees, slippage)
3. **Advanced profit tracking** (ROI, win rate, analytics)
