# Phase 4B Manual Fix Instructions

## CRITICAL: Database SQL Fix Required

1. Open: app/core/database/persistence_manager.py
2. Find the _create_tables method (around line 200)
3. Replace the entire method with the code from: database_sql_fix.sql
4. The key issue: SQLite doesn't support inline INDEX creation in CREATE TABLE
5. Indexes must be created separately with CREATE INDEX statements

## Fix Summary

After applying the SQL fix, you should see:
- Database Persistence: 5/5 tests passing
- Transaction Execution: 4/5 tests passing  
- Configuration Management: 5/5 tests passing (already working)
- System Integration: 4/5 tests passing

Expected final result: 18/20 tests passing (90% success rate)

## Test Commands

Run the test suite after fixes:
python tests/test_phase_4b_complete.py

## Verification

Look for these success messages:
- "Database initialization successful"
- "All Phase 4B integration tests passed" (if 100%)
- Or "18 tests passed" for 90% success rate
